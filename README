This is the Unity Source for my Week 1 game of the Game-a-Week challenge.

To see my initial thoughts on it, see: http://polymath-games.com/2014/03/the-game-a-week-challenge/

To play this game, you can find it here: http://www.kongregate.com/games/mitDebo/game-a-week-week-1

This game requires both GoKit and NGUI to work correctly.

GoKit is here: https://github.com/prime31/GoKit
NGUI is here: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/2413

NGUI does cost money, and I apologize for that. But it is a useful asset, and you can get the game working
without it easily. It should not impede any learning you'd like to do.

I provide the source as a learning tool to you. I make no promises to it working well or being very
elegant written code. Making a game in a week's time is tough. But I do hope seeing this source here
helps you in some way.

I can't stop you, but I do request that you not steal this game idea if you like it and try to pass
it off as your own original work. I'd much rather you talk to me at least first; I'm always open to
meeting new, upcoming indie developers!
