This is the Unity Source for my Week 1 game of the Game-a-Week challenge.

To understand the Game-a-Week challenge, go here: http://ramiismail.com/2014/02/game-a-week/

To see my initial thoughts on it, see: http://polymath-games.com/2014/03/the-game-a-week-challenge/

To play this game, you can find it here: http://www.kongregate.com/games/mitDebo/game-a-week-week-1

I provide the source as a learning tool to you. I make no promises to it working well or being very
elegant written code. Making a game in a week's time is tough. But I do hope seeing this source here
helps you in some way.

I can't stop you, but I do request that you not steal this game idea if you like it and try to pass
it off as your own original work. I'd much rather you talk to me at least first; I'm always open to
meeting new, upcoming indie developers!
